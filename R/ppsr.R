#' ppsr: An R implementation of the Predictive Power Score (PPS)
#'
#' The PPS is an asymmetric, data-type-agnostic score that can detect linear or
#' non-linear relationships between two columns. The score ranges from 0
#' (no predictive power) to 1 (perfect predictive power). It can be used as an
#' alternative to the correlation (matrix).
